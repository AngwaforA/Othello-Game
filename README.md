# Othello-Game
A board game for 2 players which are represented as white and black discs.
Players play by surrounding the opponents discs with his.
But this only happens when the disc is placed on a valid position  for position a not free at once.
When a player surrounds the opponents discs, the discs are flipped taking the color of the current player(white or black)
I used 1 for white and 2 for black.
