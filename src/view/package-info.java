/**
 * Package of the view classes for GameView.
 * The classes in this package depend on the processing library to create a GUI.
 * <p>
 * Start the game through the main method in
 * {@link view.GameView}
 * <p>
 * The view decides how to display the game to the user.
 * The view should never have a reference to the model i.e
 * Instead, it should communicate the user input to the controller, which handles this input.
